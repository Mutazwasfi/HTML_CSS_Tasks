    <span>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an
        empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but
        he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few
        things in the box.
    </span><br><br>
        Jack would really like...
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
            </ul>
        You can get all this (and more) at an online toy
        store. Two very popular ones are <a href="#">toysrus.com</a> and
        <a href="#">eTOYS</a>.
